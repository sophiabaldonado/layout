# Layout

A tool for building worlds in VR. 

Layout is [LÃ–VR](https://lovr.org) library that makes it easy to rapidly create full-scale environments.  You can load OBJ and glTF assets and arrange them directly in VR with your controllers.  Layout is also highly configurable and scriptable, so you can build your own tools for the editor and integrate them directly with your game.
